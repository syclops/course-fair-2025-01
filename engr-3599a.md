# Longer-term Software Development

This course will teach you basics of developing software in the context of a
larger project. You will learn a few skills useful for running a software
project, including how to review code, write good tests, and manage software
teams. You will practice these skills by applying them to your existing software
projects, which can be from SCOPE, project teams, research groups, etc.

On some weeks, there will be a pre-reading or video to watch, and we will
spend the class meeting discussing some of these concepts. On other weeks, we
may try applying these concepts to your projects, by workshopping an existing
project together.

You are expected to have taken SoftDes. This means having a machine running
Linux (dual boot, WSL, VM, etc.) and some familiarity with the command line and
Python programming.

## Requirements and Recommendations

- ENGR 2510: Software Design or equivalent
- **You are STRONGLY recommended to have at least one partner and a project plan
  when you sign up for this course. If you do not, you will be assigned a
  software project to work on for the semester.**

## Schedule

This course will meet once a week for the entire semester.

The following topics will be spread out through the semester, with additional
topics, project check-ins, or work time as needed.

- Introduction and Tooling
- Software Requirements
- Teaming
- Code Reviews
- Documentation
- Testing
- Dependencies and Versioning

## Assessment

Each week, you will be expected to submit a journal reflection either about the
concepts that week or on the progress of your project. You will also be asked to
define deliverables for your software project early in the semester, including
evidence that you have applied the concepts in class to your project. You will
be graded on a combination of your journal entries and your software project.
