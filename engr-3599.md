## Meeting Times/Location

This course meets **every Thursday, 1-2:40pm, in MAC 326.**

## Course Goals

This course is primarily about **discovering, understanding, and applying
computational tools** to help you in your computing work.

After taking this course, students should be able to:

- Define key terms associated with the tools/topics covered.
- Describe the computational problems that the tools aim to solve.
- Use documentation to discover different ways of using these tools.
- Explain how to apply these tools to solve their corresponding problems.
- Apply the tools to complete tasks in both known and new contexts.

### Detailed Course Goals

**Discovery**: This course aims to help you find new tools that are common in
industry, easy to use, and useful.

There's an app for that. Knowledge is half the battle. However you say it, just
knowing that a tool exists for a job is knowledge that needs to be discovered.
For example, did you know that there are tools to:

- Install/update a bunch of tools on Windows without clicking through
  installers? (Ninite: https://ninite.com/)
- Get nicely formatted local weather information from the command line?
  (wttr.in: https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in)
- Generate QR code images based on text? (qrencode:
  https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/)

Because of this, one of the aims of this course is to introduce you to tools
that you may find useful as you do different types of computational work. The
tools are geared towards software development (i.e., maintaining and deploying
software), but the course will build skills helpful for most types of
computational work.

**Understanding**: This course aims to help you build an accurate, robust
conceptual understanding of the course topics and tools.

A major challenge in learning computing is understanding the "notional machine":
a good mental model of what the machine is doing. For this course, we focus on
building this mental model for specific tools, including:

- The problem that a specific tool aims to solve
- The concepts that the tools works with
- Predicting the output of a tool without running it

Among other things, having good mental models for your tools will help you
understand why the Bash command `foo = bar` does not do what most people think
it does, or why a campus once was unable to send email more than 500 miles away:

**Application**: This course aims to help you apply the tools you learn to doing
useful computational work.

At the end of the day, the tools covered in this course help you achieve tasks
more effectively. You're likely to encounter those tasks in your work, and the
course aims to help you practice using the tools for those tasks.

The course also aims to help you transfer your knowledge about these tools to
new contexts:

- You may be asked to apply a tool to a new problem setting not covered in
  class.
- You may be asked to use a tool using options or configurations beyond what
  we've seen in class.

At the end of this course, you should feel comfortable learning a new tool on
your own to accomplish a task that you may not have done before.

### Overlap with Olin Learning Outcomes (OLOs)

The goals of this course overlap with several college-wide Olin Learning
Outcomes (OLOs):

- **Develop and Apply Knowledge, Skills, Approaches, and Methods**: You will
  learn about a variety of problems in computing and tools to solve them, as
  well as the conceptual framework behind these tools.
- **Think Critically**: Some of the problems you solve, or your project topic,
  may require you to consider broad contextual information, and evaluate the
  situation to develop an effective solution.
- **Develop and Apply Self-Directed Learning Abilities**: You are expected to
  learn parts of the course tools and techniques on your own, and to complete a
  self-directed project on a topic of interest.
- **Communicate Effectively**: In homework and in your project, you are expected
  to clearly communicate your understanding of the key concepts.

## Activities

We ask you to engage in four different activities (described below) to meet the
learning goals above.

**Readings/Quizzes**: We expect you to do some pre-readings and an associated
quiz before most class meetings. They are multiple choice, and on Canvas.

One goal of the quiz is to make sure that you understand just enough of the
topic and/or tool to engage in the in-class exercises. Usually, these questions
will ask you for the definition of a term or concept.

Another goal of the quiz is to test your knowledge of previous concepts covered
in the course. Questions will cover definitions of terms or concepts from
previous readings, but may also test lessons taught in class.

**In-class exercises**: For most class meetings, we will cover the topic of the
week in more detail, and ask you to complete some exercises as practice.

The exercises are intended to help you build up conceptual and application
skills in the topic. These are usually table discussion questions or quick
programming tasks, though we may occasionally do "unplugged" (computerless)
tasks as well.

**Problem sets**: Each week until the project, we will ask you to complete a
problem set to help you practice the topic or tool for that week.

You should expect that each problem set will consist of a few conceptual
questions and a few application questions (where you write code).

Problem sets are submitted and graded individually, though you are allowed to
discuss the problems with your classmates.

**Project**: In the final weeks of the semester, we will ask you to complete one
project in which you explore a topic or tool of interest to you. We encourage
you to do the project with a partner, though you are free to work on your own.

The topic or tool needs to be related to computing and to the course in some
way. How you explore the topic or tool is up to you, but you must produce some
concrete artifact of your exploration. This might be:

- An integration of the tool into an existing software project, as shown by a
  commit or pull request.
- If exploring a new tool, a problem set and solutions.
- An article comparing a reasonably complete range of tools for a particular
  purpose, with accompanying data.
- A new software project that _primarily_ uses one or more of the tools/topics
  from the course.

A project that _primarily_ uses a tool/topic means that more than 50% of the
code/work is focused on it.

There are several check-ins throughout the project, as well as a final
presentation.

## Assessment

We use your submitted quizzes, problem sets, and project deliverables to assess
your learning in the course. We do this both to measure your progress towards
the learning goals of the course, as well as to give you feedback to improve
that progress. Below are some notes on these assessments.

**Quizzes**: We use quizzes to check for a basic understanding of terms and
concepts. These are scored based on correctness, with no other feedback given.

Because quizzes are intended to help prepare you for discussion, credit isn't
given for quizzes taken after the corresponding class meeting.

That being said, it's reasonable to miss a quiz due to other things, or to have
a rough time with a quiz. Because of this, we drop the lowest quiz from your
average.

**Problem Sets**: We intend problem sets to help you learn and to test your
understanding. Thus problem sets are graded based on a combination of effort,
completeness, correctness, and readability.

Correctness testing is largely automated, so our comments focus on ways to help
you improve. The problem sets do not have numerical grades, and are instead
evaluated using one of three qualitative grades:

- **Exemplary**: The submission exceeds our requirements, and we would use it as
  an example of a good submission.
- **Satisfactory**: The submission meets the expectations we have for your
  understanding of this concept.
- **Not Yet**: The submission needs improvement to meet our requirements.

We allow you to address our feedback and resubmit assignments until near the end
of the semester. Assuming you address our feedback, your assignment grade can go
up. Only one resubmission will be graded per week.

**Project**: The project has a proposal and several review components. These are
graded based on engagement (completeness and effort), using the same qualitative
scale as above.

The final project deliverables (the project and presentation) will also be
graded using the qualitative scale, based on engagement, correctness, and
readability.

**Professionalism**: A small part of your grade depends on professionalism,
specifically, how you interact with your peers and the course staff.

In this course, the aspect of professionalism that we value most highly is
**clear expectations**: we want you to be clear what you expect of us, and we
want you to make it clear what we can expect of you.

In the context of expectations, one of the most important aspects is that **to
be professional, you need to be communicative and proactive**. Some concrete
examples of this:

- If you know that you will not finish something in time, you should write to
  the course staff reasonably in advance of the deadline to propose a new time.
- If illness, travel, or something else prevents you from coming to class,
  especially for a check-in, you should contact the course staff. You don't need
  to write a long explanation - even just a heads-up is valuable.
- If you feel that you do not understand the course material as well as you
  would like to, you should contact someone who can help: a peer, the course
  staff, or StAR.

Repeatedly missing submissions without notification or similar behavior can have
a high cost, including greater stress on the course staff or us not being able
to provide useful help with the course. Please be considerate of your peers and
the course staff.

**Final Grades**: Your course grade is computing using a weighted average of
quizzes, problem sets, the project, and professionalism.

Because we generally use qualitative grades, we do not have a numerical
weighting of each category. You should generally expect that each of quizzes,
problem sets, and the project will be weighted equally, with whichever category
you score best in being weighted extra.

Professionalism is a smaller part of your final course grade. Assume that it has
the potential to raise or lower your final course grade by a single letter in
extreme cases, but we expect the effect to be much less for most people.

## Course Expectations

### Health

If you are feeling sick and suspect that you may be contagious, you should not
come to class. Be considerate of others, and wear a mask as a precaution.

If you notify us in advance, we may be able to arrange for remote participation,
but this is not guaranteed.

### Punctuality

We ask that you come to class on time. There is usually a short video or fun
fact to start a class session off, but if you will be more than a few minutes
late, please notify the instructor.

Quizzes have a hard deadline, and late submissions will not receive credit.
However, the lowest quiz score will be dropped.

Problem sets and project deliverables do not have strict deadlines per se, but
credit will not be given for anything submitted after grading for that
assignment starts. Grading can start any time after the deadline, though you can
expect a few hours of leeway.

In general, if you know that something will be late, you should feel free to ask
if something can be submitted late. Despite the above policies on late work, the
course staff will take requests for exceptions (though we can't guarantee that
we will always grant extensions).

### Collaboration

While submission for most work in this course is done individually, we encourage
you to collaborate with other students. However, we ask that you limit
collaboration to ideas only; sharing ideas is allowed, but sharing code is not.
Please do not "spoil the fun" of solving the problems for other students!

On projects, if parts of your work are unclear, there is a possibility that we
will ask you to explain it; you should be prepared to explain any part of the
work with your name on it, **even if you are in a group and did not do that work
yourself**.

### Asking Questions

**Please use the class Discord server when asking most questions.** This ensures
that all of us will see and have the chance to respond to questions.

We will make an exception for particularly sensitive questions (e.g., requests
due to special circumstances or questions concerning sensitive information).

If you are stuck on a problem, it helps to be precise about what you are trying
to do and where you are stuck. It is particularly helpful if you include what
you have already tried, and a _minimal working example_ that isolates the
problem you are running into (rather than simply saying that your code doesn't
work). While we may be able to help you without this, it may take significantly
longer to do so.

### Giving Feedback

We always welcome feedback on the design, content, or delivery of this course.
You can do so in Discord, or anonymously through a classmate.

We are generally able to respond most effectively to feedback if you are
specific and constructive. Rather than simply saying that you enjoyed or didn't
enjoy the day's activities, please try to point out how something helped your
learning or a change you would make if given the chance.

### Accessibility

Olin College of Engineering is committed to ensuring the full participation of
all students in its programs. If you have a documented disability (or think you
may have a disability) and, as a result, need a reasonable accommodation to
participate in this class, complete course requirements, or benefit from the
College’s programs or services, contact
[Disability Services at Olin (DSO)](http://www.olin.edu/academic-life/student-affairs-and-resources/disability-services/)
as soon as possible. To receive any academic accommodation, you must be
appropriately registered with DSO. The DSO works with students confidentially
and does not disclose any disability-related information without their
permission. The DSO serves as a clearinghouse on disability issues and works in
partnership with faculty and all other student service offices. For further
information about services for students with disabilities, please contact the
DSO.

We assume that all of us learn in different ways, and that the organization of
any course will accommodate each student differently. For example, you may
prefer to process information by speaking and listening, so that some of the
written handouts we provide may be difficult to absorb. Please talk to us as
soon as you can about your individual learning needs and how this course can
best accommodate them. Even if you do not have a documented disability, remember
that there are other support services, including Writing Tutors, NINJAs, ARCs,
and Peer Tutors.

### Diversity

It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives
will be well served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed
both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this
class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present
materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality,
disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. We expect
students to conduct themselves in a way that respects the experiences and
identities of all members of the class. Your suggestions are encouraged and
appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course
for you personally or for other students or student groups. In addition, if any
of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let us know so
that we can make arrangements for you.

### Work-Life Balance

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this
semester by eating well, exercising, getting enough sleep, and taking some time
to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone.
There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of
the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support
sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life
events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to
seek support. Check out
[Olin's Mental Health and Wellness services](http://www.olin.edu/academic-life/student-affairs-and-resources/mental-health-wellness/).
Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty, or family member you trust for help
getting connected to the support that can help.
